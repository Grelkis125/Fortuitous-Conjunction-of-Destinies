<Agrarian Revolt>
A peasant revolt against the oligarchic regime that followed the Bleak Century. Led by Iron Willow and Peridot Wren, the revolt initially aimed to redistribute land from the rural aristocracy back to the peasantry who worked it. The revolt escalated into outright civil war, with the goal of eliminating the grip of the merchants and landowners on the government. The success of the revolt led to the foundation of the examination-based system of government in Tenreeds today.

<Bleak Century>
A hundred year period where Tenreeds and the broader Southwest were beset by undead as Shadowlands opened up across the region. The Tenreeds counteroffensive was spearheaded by a Solar Exalt under the tutelage of the Cult of the Illuminated. In the modern day, they are known as Embodies-the-Sun, and held to be either or a mortal incarnation or vessel for the spirit of the Unconquered Sun.

<Tengese Pursuit> After the exile of the Republic from the mainland, forces of the old Empire of An Teng pursued them to what is now the Northern Isle to ensure Tenreeds would never rise again. They succeeded in driving the government-in-exile from the Northern to the Southern Isle, but the onset of the Bleak Century forced them to withdraw.
